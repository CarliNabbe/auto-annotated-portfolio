Tweet Off was my Graduation project where I made an interactive quiz where you can use A.I. to generate different Tweets or write your own.

It's basically a two people quiz, where the first player writes and the second player has to guess if it's real or fake. The first player decides if he wants to write something himself, or writes a prompt where the A.I. creates a Tweet. Either of them will get sent to the second player, where he will guess if it's human or A.I. generated.

The purpose of this game is to raise awareness for people to see how hard it has become to distinguise the different between real and fake content. Especially in a time where fake news is a huge thing, this will only become increasingly more difficult, seeing as A.I. also becomes smarter and humanlike.



For me as a developer I really loved making this quiz. It's a really concerning problem, and even more so in these times where almost everything is A.I.
