  Breakout is a classic game that's been around for years. This is my spinoff on
  the game with own powerups to earn.

Breakout was a coding exercise to get familiar with Typescript and how classes work. The game is made up of different instances of objects that are placed on the screen. These objects move independantly from eachother and also act in different ways when collision is used. For example, whenever the ball is colliding with the paddle object, it needs to be bounced back to the top of the screen.

The bricks use different properties. Depending on how many times they're hit, they will change colour. This is a great example of polymorphism.

Some of the bricks contain a powerup that whenever it's caught by the paddle, changes it depending on the powerup. For example, the ball can go faster, or the paddle becomes bigger.



For me as a developer, I loved using different types of classes to initiate multiple objects to create a game. It was a little challenging to continue sometimes, as I was not aware of the multiple steps it takes to create a game like this. But taking it step by step I enjoyed making this little demo.
