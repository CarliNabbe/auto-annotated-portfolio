For the game Infiltraliens I've been part of a game development team with 17 other people. Here we've had around 3 months to make a game that would be published online on Steam. In the end the game has been downloaded around 10.000 times all over the world. To this day it is still a free playable game.

In the game you play as an alien called Gorp, who needs to rescue his alien friends from the hands of the scientists in Area 52. Gorp needs to find his friends and take them to the pickup point to get them back to the spaceship. This doesn't sound too hard, but Gorp is not used to the gravity on earth, which makes him wobble around the place. With this ragdoll mechanic, Gorp is challenged to sneak around and not get caught himself.

My role here in this project was as a game designer. With a small subteam we've been concepting the game over and over again until we found something that sounded really fun and challenging to play around with. As designers we have been constantly iterating over the game to test and see what worked best and if people liked with the direction we've been going.

When the concept was done, our job changed mainly to level design. I've created different level ideas, which the developers have coded out for us.
